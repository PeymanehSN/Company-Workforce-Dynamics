# Employee Distribution Analysis

## Project Overview
This project conducts an analysis of employee demographics and employment patterns within a company, using a dataset that encapsulates various aspects of workforce composition. The primary aim is to understand the diversity, distribution, and dynamics of the company's employees. The analysis was conducted using MySQL for data cleaning and manipulation, followed by visualization in PowerBI to provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

## Data and Methodology
The dataset includes detailed employee information such as age, gender, race, job title, department, and employment status. Initial data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using MySQL, ensuring data integrity and relevance by removing inconsistencies and structuring the data for analysis.

### Analysis Objectives
The analysis focuses on several key workforce metrics:
- **Gender and Race/Ethnicity Distribution**: Evaluating diversity in the workplace.
- **Age and Tenure Analysis**: Understanding the age distribution and tenure across departments.
- **Geographical and Departmental Distribution**: Analyzing location-based employee distribution and department-specific dynamics.
- **Employment Trends**: Tracking changes in employee count over time and analyzing turnover rates.

### Tools Used
- **MySQL**: Employed for data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.
- **PowerBI**: Used to create dynamic visualizations and dashboards that facilitate an interactive exploration of the data.

## Insights and Findings
Key insights derived from the analysis include:
- A higher prevalence of male employees and significant representation from the White demographic, with minimal representation from Native Hawaiian and American Indian groups.
- The largest age groups within the company are 25-34 and 35-44, indicating a relatively young workforce.
- Most employees are based at the headquarters, with a detailed breakdown of remote versus on-site employee distribution.
- The Marketing and Training departments exhibit the highest turnover rates, while Legal and Auditing enjoy longer employee tenures.

## Interactive Dashboard Features
The PowerBI dashboard allows users to interactively explore the data with filters and drill-down capabilities that provide a deeper understanding of:
- Drill down into the specifics of gender and race across departments to identify areas needing policy adjustment.
-	Explore age demographics and tenure within each department to better understand career progression and retention factors.
-	Visually assess employee distribution across states to strategize on potential new markets for talent acquisition.
